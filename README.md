## The objectives of this project are as follows - 
- This project aims to create an online video-sharing platform. 
- It registers a user using basic information like Name, Username and password, password is encrypted and stored in the database.
- When the user logs in, the credentials are validated and a token is assigned. The token validates the user session and their interactions on the portal.
- The app allows users to view their feed with videos posted by people they are following.
- Users can share their videos by uploading videos that are less than a minute long.
- Users can follow other users to view their content. 
- Once a user has been followed their content becomes visible on the follower's feed.
- Build an application which scales automatically based on the load on the pod.
